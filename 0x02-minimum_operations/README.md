Minimum Operations Challenge

This code is a Python3 challenge that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in a file.

How it works

The function minOperations(n) uses three variables to keep track of the number of characters in the file, how many H's are copied, and the number of operations performed to achieve the desired number of H's. The algorithm works as follows:

While the number of pasted characters is less than n, the algorithm loops.
If the clipboard is empty, it copies all the characters in the file, increments the operation counter by one, and continues to the next loop.
If there is only one character in the file, it pastes the clipboard, increments the operation counter by one, and continues to the next loop.
If the remaining number of characters to paste is less than the number of characters in the clipboard, it is impossible to achieve the desired number of H's and the function returns 0.
If the remaining number of characters to paste is not divisible by the number of pasted characters, it pastes the clipboard, increments the operation counter by one, and continues to the next loop.
If the remaining number of characters to paste is divisible by the number of pasted characters, it copies all the characters in the file, pastes the clipboard, increments the operation counter by two, and continues to the next loop.
If the number of pasted characters is equal to n, the function returns the operation counter. Otherwise, it returns 0.


Usage
To use this function, call minOperations(n) and pass in the desired number of H's. The function will return an integer that represents the fewest number of operations needed to achieve the desired number of H's. If it is impossible to achieve the desired number of H's, the function will return 0.
